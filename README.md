## 🚨 Problem Statement (PS)

India faces frequent water management challenges like undetected groundwater depletion, water leakages, and delayed civic response. With Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLR) installed in many regions, real-time water monitoring remains underutilized due to lack of intelligent processing, public awareness, and system integration.

## 🧠 Our Solution – HydroSense

**HydroSense** is an end-to-end smart water monitoring and alert system that:
- Detects **real-time anomalies** in water levels using AI
- Predicts **groundwater availability trends** using ML
- Sends **automated SMS/voice alerts** to the public & corporation
- Collects & visualizes **climate news** using live web scraping
- Allows **citizens to raise water-related complaints** with geo-tagging
- Offers **separate admin and public dashboards** for full transparency

> ⚙️ "HydroSense empowers proactive action through technology, turning raw water data into life-saving insights."

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

- **Edge Layer**: DWLR → Telemeter → Cloud (ThingSpeak)
- **Back-End Layer**:
  - Anomaly Detection → `Isolation Forest`
  - Forecasting Model → `Random Forest`
  - Python APIs for processing, training, and alert triggers
- **Front-End Layer**:
  - Admin & Public Dashboards → `ReactJS + HTML + CSS`
  - Complaint Platform → Geo-location & Image-based Form
  - News Dashboard → Climate + Water News via `Web Scraping`

## 🧪 AI & ML Models Used

| Purpose | Model | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 🔍 Anomaly Detection | Isolation Forest | Captures outliers in DWLR readings and flags unexpected behavior |
| 📈 Groundwater Forecast | Random Forest | Predicts future groundwater levels from past trends & environmental features |

---

## 📱 Modules Overview

### 🌊 1. **DWLR Anomaly Detection**
- Real-time DWLR data stream (via ThingSpeak API)
- Detects abnormal fluctuations & pinpoints location
- Dashboard-friendly API output

### 📡 2. **Alert System (Twilio)**
- Voice/SMS alerts for:
  - Public: “Water level critically low!”
  - Service Manager: “DWLR unit malfunction”
  - Corporation: “Leakage detected nearby”
- Fully automated using Twilio API

### 📰 3. **Water & Climate News Aggregator**
- Live news scraper using Python & Selenium
- Keywords: `"climate", "water", "flood", "drought", "global warming"`
- Updates public dashboard with environmental news

### 🔮 4. **Groundwater Prediction System**
- Streams past DWLR + environmental data
- Forecasts groundwater trends monthly
- Plotted on a visual dashboard

### 📍 5. **Public Complaint Raising Platform**
- Location-based complaint form with image upload
- Complaint tracker for status updates
- Admin dashboard to resolve issues & close tickets
